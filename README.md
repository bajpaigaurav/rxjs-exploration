- What is observable ?
  - follows producer consumer model
- What is Lazy vs Eager Execution of Observable ?
  - Lazy execution means - execution/evaluation only happens when there is need for it ie there is any subscriber for it else it will not be computed.
  - Eager Execution means - weather there is any consumer or any need for the data or not, still computation will be done on top of it.
- Setting Data pipeline with observable
  - [Usage of tap, filter, map](./setting-data-pipeline.js)
  - Demostrate effects of datapipeline over the native observable.
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous Data Sources 
  - [Synchronous Data Source](./synchronous-data-source.js) - Where cause and effect are at the same time 
  - [Asynchronous Data Source](./asynchronous-data-source.js) - Where consumers need to wait for to happen to happen
- [Making Sync Data Source to act like Async](./making-sync-to-async.js)
- Multicasting vs Unicasting
  - Subjects as Multicasting operator
    - What is multicasting ? - Refers to having a producer and consumer model where mutiple producers and multiple consumers can produce/subscribe to same observable to broadcast/consume the events.
  - Subject Types :
    - Behavior Subject
      - Emits the last emitted value to a late subscriber. Needs are dafult value to be passed while creating it.
    - Async Subject
      - Emits the last value once the observable completes to all the subscriber
    - Replay Subject
      - Keeps are buffer of all the events emitted so far - and passes the previoulsy emitted values to new late subscriber
  - RxJs - Operators 
    - Creational Operators 
      - from
      - of
      - defer
      - timer
      - interval
      - range
      - fromEvent
    - Filtering Operators
      - filter
      - first
      - take
      - last - dafault and can be used with pridicate as well
